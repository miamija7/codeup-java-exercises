*** JAVA II - Collections ***

Collections we will talk about: ArrayList and HashMap


Collection:
- a data structure that can be used to group, or collect, objects
- Java standard library: a collection of code that comes with Java, contains collections
- java.util package has collection classes


Array Lists:
- represents an array that can change its size
- elements must all be objects, and same type
- ArrayList is like a wrapper around an array that handles resizing for you
- they have methods that handle common array operations

SYNTAX: ArrayList<String> roasts = new ArrayList<>();

Method	        Description
.size	        returns the number of elements in the array
.add	        add an element to the collection (optionally) at a specified index
.get	        return the element at the specified index
.indexOf        return the first found index of the given item, or -1 if not found
.contains	    check if a collection contains a given element
.lastIndexOf	find the last index of the given element, -1 if not found
.isEmpty	    check if the list is empty
.remove	        remove the first occurrence of an item, or an item at a given index

NOTE:
- specify type in collection with <>
- must contain objects, we specify Integer instead of int
- add method is overloaded
- no length property, use .size()
- collections all have toString methods on them
- return value of .remove depends on how it is invoked (index returns element, object returns boolean)



Hash Maps:
- data structure for key-value pairs
- ALL the keys in the hash map must be of the same type
- ALL the values must be of the same type
- BUT keys and the values don't necessarily have to be the same type

SYNTAX: HashMap<String, String> usernames = new HashMap<>();

Method	            Description
.put	            set a key-value pair
.get	            return the value associated with the given key, or null
.getOrDefault	    like .get, but with a defined value instead of null
.containsKey	    check if a key exists in the map
.containsValue	    check if a value exists in the map
