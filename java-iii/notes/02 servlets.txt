                                 (JavaScript)
                                  (browser)



- communication consists of requests and responses
- all of our Java code will reside server-side
- opposed to client-side, which is where our JavaScript runs
- user will not know that our server is running Java
- the end result of the code running on our server should be a valid HTML document


Servlets:
- A servlet is a Java class
- it extends the HttpServlet class
- it handles HTTP requests and responses
- allows us to create dynamic web pages with Java (create HTML responses)


Using Servlets:
- You will need:
    1. The servlet libraries
    2. A Web Server that will interact our servlet classes
    3. servlet dependencies within our pom.xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
            <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
            <version>3.1.0</version>
        </dependency>



Tomcat:
- Apache Tomcat
- it is our servlet container
- Tomcat is the piece of software that handles the lower level networking details of HTTP requests
- Tomcat expects our application to be deployed as a WAR (Web ARchive).
- This is a JAR file with additional structure.


WAR File:
- a WAR file is an artifact, a byproduct of our source code, but not the source code itself
- a WAR file is a file used to distribute a collection of JAR-files, JavaServer Pages, Java Servlets, Java classes,
  XML files, tag libraries, static web pages and other resources that together constitute a web application.
   | ./               <------- root directory (my-application.war)
   |     index.html   <------+
   |     hello.jsp    <------+
   |     css/         <------|---- static assets + jsp
   |     js/          <------+
   |     WEB-INF/
   |         web.xml  <----------- configuration
   |         lib/     <----------- external dependencies
   |         classes/ <----------- your compiled classes

- a typical Maven project structure / our structure
    | ./               <-- project root
    | pom.xml
    | src/main/
    |     java/        <-- your classes, including servlets, go here
    |     webapp/      <-- web *facet* | static files / assets and jsps go in here
    |         css/
    |         js/
    |         img/
    |         WEB-INF/ <-- non-public files go here



Configure IntelliJ:
- in addition to this project structure, we will need to configure IntelliJ to run our project
- IntelliJ Servlet Application Setup
    1. General Setup
        If you cloned the project, you will need to:
            1. Set the project SDK:
                a. File -> Project Structure
                b. For "Project SDK", choose the version of Java you are using
            2. Add the pom.xml as a Maven project
                a. Right click on the pom.xml
                b. Select "Add as Maven Project" (you'll see an "m" icon to the left of the pom.xml)
            3. Mark the src/main/java directory as sources root
                a. Right click on the java directory
                b. Select "Mark Directory as..."
                c. Select "Sources Root"

    2. Run Configuration
        Tell IntelliJ about tomcat (do once per computer)

            1. In Intellij, Run -> Edit Configurations...
            2. Create a new configuration (click the +) -- "Tomcat - local"
            3. For the "Name", enter a description of your project, for example, "Adlister Server"
            4. Next to "Application Server", click configure
            5. In the dialog that opens, you will need to provide IntelliJ with the path to your local tomcat install.
               If you installed tomcat with brew (if you ran the Codeup setup script you did), the path to tomcat:
                   | Intel: /usr/local/Cellar/tomcat/x.x.x/libexec/
                   | M1 Chip: /opt/homebrew/Cellar/tomcat@9
                   | Get your tomcat version: ls /usr/local/Cellar/tomcat ls /opt/homebrew/Cellar/tomcat@9

        If you've already configured tomcat:

            1. Run -> Edit Configurations...
            2. Create a new configuration (click the +) -- "Tomcat - local"
            3. Choose a name that describes your project
            4. For "Application Server", choose the version of tomcat you setup previously

    3. Configure a war to be deployed
        Under the tomcat run configuration you just created:

            1. At the bottom of the dialog under "Before launch:"
            2. Choose "Build Artifacts"
            3. Check the name of your project + :war exploded
            4. Check under the deployment tab, at the bottom find the input Application context the value there should be just /

    :) **** The application will be available at http://localhost:8080 ****
