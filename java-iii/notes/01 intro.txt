*** JAVA III - INTRO ***

We will now learn about how we can use Java to interact with the web, and eventually build full-stack web applications.

Throughout this module, we will be building the AdLister project. The AdLister project is essentially a bare bones Craigslist clone. It will have the following features:

Users can view all the ads that have been posted
An ad has a title, a description, and a link to the user that posted it
Users can register for the site
Users can log in to the application
Logged in users can create ads with a title and description
There is much more you will be able to add to the application, and the description above is far from a complete application, but over the course of the next few lessons, we will build out the described functionality.

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

Use Java to dynamically generate html pages
Use Java to interact with a MySQL database
Understand:

The Model-View-Controller Paradigm
The request-response lifecycle of HTTP requests
How the dependencies of a project are managed with Maven
Know How To:

Create servlets that are mapped to a URI
Use JSPs and the JSTL to generate html pages
Establish database connections and use connections to execute queries
Use prepared statements to avoid SQL injection
Escape user input when shown as HTML
Properly handle user's passwords
