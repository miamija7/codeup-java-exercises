*** JAVA I - Strings ***


Focus: how to work with and manipulate strings.


String Definition:
- a String is letters, numbers, and special characters strung together
- strings are objects, not primitives
- String variables are a reference type, not a primitive type
- the == operator with two objects checks if both sides are the same reference, if they refer to the same object
