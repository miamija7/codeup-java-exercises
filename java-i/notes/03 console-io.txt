*** JAVA I - Console Input and Output ***

Printing Data To The Console:
    String name = "codeup";
    System.out.printf("Hello there, %s. Nice to see you.%n", name);
    -->  Hello there, codeup. Nice to see you.


Getting Input From The Console:
- the Scanner class allows us to get data input that the user enters into the console
- Import Statements:
    + before using the Scanner class, we need to import it
    +


Packages:
- a namespace for a group of related code
- we'll define classes in their own packages
- for now, we'll be using code from the java.util package


Import Statements:
- what let us use code from other packages
- include code from different directories and Java libraries
- eventually, every class you create will end up with multiple import statements
- imports go at the top of your file, before the class definition
- import the Scanner class from the java.util package


NOTE:
IDEs usually can automatically handle import statements for us. In IntelliJ, you can press (option + enter)
after typing the Scanner class name to have IntelliJ automatically add the correct import for you. (If there
are multiple classes in different packages that have the same name, you will be prompted to choose which one to use).


Using the Scanner class:
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter something: ");
    String userInput = scanner.next();
    System.out.println("You entered: --> \"" + userInput + "\" <--");
    --> Enter something: codeup
    --> You entered: --> "codeup" <--


Scanner Inputs:
scanner.next()          word
scanner.nextLine()      line
scanner.nextInt()       number
